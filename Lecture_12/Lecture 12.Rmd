#Panel Data

To do panel data you'll be using the function plm()

There is an option for "within" - that is the fixed effects model. This is because you are taking differences within a country 

```{r}
library(plm)

wdi <- WDI(country = "all", start=2000, end=2015, extra="TRUE",
           indicator=c("NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG","SL.TLF.CACT.FE.ZS","SP.POP.TOTL"))
```
```{r}

paneldata <- plm.data(wdi, ))


fixed <- plm(NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG ~ SL.TLF.CACT.FE.ZS + SP.POP.TOTL , data=wdi, model="within")
summary(fixed)
```
